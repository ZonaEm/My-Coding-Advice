                <h2>Fear is OK</h2>
                <p>Learning new things is scary. Just admit it to yourself that you don't know what you're doing and let that be your starting point. There will always be people who understand more complex ideas, who "get it" more quickly, who can produce work that is far more detailed than you. But that doesn't mean your efforts aren't valid and that there isn't a place for you in this world.</p>
 
                <h2>Exploring and screwing up can teach you new skills</h2>
                <p>I have always been the "unofficial" tech person at every job I've had (in the education field). I've been surrounded by brilliant people who don't know anything about computers/the Internet outside of how to check their email. By pressing buttons and clicking things I probably shouldn't have, I got to learn lots of things I never would have if I didn't explore ...and it made me much more valuable to my employers. <br> The same is true for the html and css files I've made so far. What happens if I add a section ID here versus a class? What about combining sections in css for design purposes? I just typed a million things wrong into my Command Line and it's still up and running, AND (eventually) I figured out how to do the thing I was tasked to do. I'm not even going to tell you how long it took me to get this dashed line on top and bottom of my section, I'm just going to sit back and let you be impressed because I figured it out! <br> Mess things up now while there are people who can't wait to help you. You'll understand what all the little mistakes that COULD happen will look like before you do them for realzies down the line.</p>
            
                <h2>Don't stop being amazing</h2>
                <p> You got this!</p>
